Create delivery pipeline for https://github.com/dev-trainings/echo-gradle-project.git project with the following steps:
1) build step:
    pulls latest code from git repository
    polls the repository for new commits at midnight (@midnight)
    builds code and publishes it to artifact repository by executing gradle publish task
    triggers second step passing in the VERSION parameter with the value of GIT_COMMIT
2) deploy on test step
    simulates project deployment on test environment by echoing version of the project on console
    triggers third step passing in current parameters
3) run acceptance tests
    pulls code from git repository in the version specified by VERSION parameter
    runs acceptance tests by executing gradle acceptanceTests task
    triggers fourth step passing in current parameters
4) deploy on production step
    simulates project deployment on production environment by echoing version of the project on console
Add a view for this pipeline (e.g. delivery pipeline view or build pipeline view)

TIP: use Parametrized Trigger plugin
TIP: Git plugin keeps commit SHA in GIT_COMMIT environmental variable
TIP: do one thing at a time
TIP: create pipeline view early on

OPTIONAL: apply DRY principle by extracting common parts to helper methods
